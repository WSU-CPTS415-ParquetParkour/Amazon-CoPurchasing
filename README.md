Project GitHub Repo: https://github.com/WSU-CPTS415-ParquetParkour/Amazon-CoPurchasing


Environment Requirements:
* Python: 3.10+
* Neo4j: 5.0+
* crudini: v0.9.3+ (for shell scripts)

Setup:
* Project root must be deployed to a directory titled 'Amazon-CoPurchasing' - this is currently used as a path anchor for relative references.
* Unzipping the archive via right-click context menu, then selecting 'extract here' has provided this in our testing.
* The application UI may be launched via /launcher.sh in the root directory.
