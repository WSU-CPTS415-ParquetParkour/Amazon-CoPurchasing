The original study performed by J. Leskovec, L. Adamic and B. Huberman was aimed at an examination of user behavior variations within the a network of product recommendations in which viral marketing displayed a notable degree of success [1](#03_ref_01).  This involved an analysis of the effectiveness of recommendation through the lense of a campaign in which discounts were granted to customers who recommended any of a retailer's products to others.  Core to this was the tracking of users purchases and recommendations which stemmed from the original recommendations.
